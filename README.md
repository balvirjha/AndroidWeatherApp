# TempToday
The app-name is TempToday and it displays the current city temperature and other weather conditions along with five day weather forecast results. User can add multiple cities to see weather conditions there and along with that i have added a home-screen widget also to keep user updated about all weather information. Minimum SDK support I kept is 14 (ICE_CREAM_SANDWICH) and, code quality is maintained in way of readability, maintainability, SOLID principles. UI is optimized for phones as well as tablets also as I created separate layout for landscape orientation along with some transition animations and view animations are also added to make the UI looks more intuitive. Since weather condition do not change very frequently so i refresh the data periodically in background and time interval to refresh current city data is 3 hours and for five day forecast it is 12 hours. Espresso unit tests is also added.

- RxJava

- Retrofit

- Room Database

- Event Bus

- Workmanager

- Kotlin

- Google Location API

- Android Permission API

- SSP SDP library

- Recycler View
